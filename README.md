# Image upload library(filePond) integration
This is a implementation of filePond library for uploading images. Here I have used laravel with blade templates.
1. Single Image
2. Multiple Images


## Single Image
The single image upload will have loading view but not preview of image.

## Multiple Images
This will have both loading effect and preview of image before upload/store.
